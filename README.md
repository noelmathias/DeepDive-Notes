# DeepDive Notes

An AI-powered system that converts long videos (lectures, YouTube videos, meetings) into:

- Structured, concept-wise notes  
- Key timestamps linked to source video  
- Action items and next steps  

This project focuses on semantic segmentation, grounded generation, and traceability rather than simple summarization.
